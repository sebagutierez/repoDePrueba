    <h1>FORMS</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>How to collect information from visitors</li>
        <li>Different kinds of form controls</li>
        <li>New HTML5 form controls</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>HOW FORMS WORK</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>A user fills in a form and then presses a button to submit the information to the server.</li>
        <li>The name of each form control is sent to the server along with the value the user enters or selects.</li>
        <li>The server processes the information using a programming language such as PHP, C#, VB.net, or Java. It may
            also store the informacion in a database.</li>
        <li>The server creates a new page to send back to the browser based on the information received.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>NAME=VALUE</h3>
    <p>To differentiate between various pieces of inputted data, information is sent from the browser to the server
        using name/value pairs. </p>

    <h2>FORM STRUCTURE</h2>
    <h3>(FORM)</h3>
    <p>Form controls live inside a form element. This element should always carry the action attribute and will usually
        have a method and id attribute too..</p>
    <h4>ACTION</h4>
    <p>Every (form) element requires an action attribute. Its value is the URL for the page on the server that will
        receive the information in the form when it is submitted.</p>
    <p>(form action="http/:www.example.com/subscribe.php" method="get")</p>
    <p>(p)This is where the form controls will appear.(/p)</p>
    <p>(/form)</p>
    <h4>METHOD</h4>
    <p>Forms can be sent using one of two methods: get o post.</p>
    <p>With the <b>GET</b> method, the values form the form are added to the end of the URL specified in the action
        attribute. The get method is ideal for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Short forms, such as search boxes</li>
        <li>When you are just retrieving data from the web server, not sending information that should be added to or
            deleted from a database.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>With the <b>POST</b> method the values are sent in what are known as HTTP headers. As a rule of thumb you should
        use the post method if your form:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Allows users to upload a file.</li>
        <li>Is very long</li>
        <li>Contains sensitive data, e.g. passwords</li>
        <li>Adds information to, or deletes information from, a database</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>ID</h4>
    <p>We look at the id attribute on page 183, but the value is used to identify the form distinctly from other
        elements on the page, and is often used by scripts, such as those that check you have entered information into
        fields that require values.</p>

    <h2>TEXT INPUT</h2>
    <h3>[INPUT]</h3>
    <p>The [input] element is used to create several different form controls. The value of the type attribute determines
        what kind of input they will be creating.</p>
    <h4>TYPE="TEXT"</h4>
    <p>When the type attribute has a value of text, it creates a single-line text input.</p>
    <h4>NAME</h4>
    <p>When users enter information into a form, the server needs to know which form control each pieces of data was
        entered into. For example, in a login form, the server needs to know what has been entered as the username and
        what has been given as the password. Therefore, each form control requires a name attribute. The value of this
        attribute identifies the form control and is sent along with the information they enter to the server.</p>
    <h4>MAXLENGTH</h4>
    <p>You can use the maxlength attribute to limit the number of characters a user may enter into the text field. Its
        value is the number fo characters they may enter. For example, if you were asking for a year, the maxlength
        attribute could have a value of 4.</p>
    <h4>SIZE</h4>
    <p>The size attribute should not be used on new forms. It was used in older forms to indicate the width of the text
        input, measured by the number of characters that would be seen.</p>
    <p>For example, a value of 3 would create a box wide enough to display three characters, although a user could enter
        more characters if they desired.</p>
    <p>In any new forms you write, CSS should be used to control the widht of form elements. The size attribute is only
        mentioned here because you may come across it when looking at older code.</p>
